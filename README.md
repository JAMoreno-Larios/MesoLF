Mesoscale volumetric light-field (MesoLF) imaging

The MesoLF hard- and software solution allows recording from thousands of neurons within volumes of ⌀ 4 × 0.2 mm, located at up to 350 µm depth in the mouse cortex, at 18 volumes per second and an effective voxel rate of ~40 megavoxels per second.

MesoLF was developed by the [Vaziri Lab](http://vaziria.com/) at [Rockefeller University](https://www.rockefeller.edu/), and is described and demonstrated in the following publication:

Nature Methods 1–10 (2023). doi:10.1038/s41592-023-01789-z

This repository will contain future updated releases of the MesoLF analysis pipeline code, which is available as Supplementary Software 1 of the publication cited above. Currently, the code published with the article is the latest available version.
